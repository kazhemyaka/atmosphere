# Atmosphere

Atmosphere is my final project from the Front-End development course at Beetroot Academy.

I chose this topic because I wanted to work with different APIs and it's a cool idea for a project. I used React and Tailwind CSS, Weather API, Unsplash API for photos to develop this project. I also used different npm packages such as formik, yup, leaflet, react-icons, weather-icons, supabase-js, dotenv.
